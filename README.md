# CS33-Notes-Set
[WIP] CS33 Notes taken directly from class materials and filtered for relativity to the course. Should contain absolutely everything needed for the course.

Course taken with Professor Glenn Reinman. Attending class is recommended just because he's such an excellent professor and lecturer.

Credit to him, Randal E. Bryant and David R. O'Hallaron (Authors of *Computer Systems: A Programmer's Perspective"*).
